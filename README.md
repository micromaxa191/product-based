# product-based


Let me start with what product-based companies are and how they are different. These are the companies that have a product of their own, which are used by other companies or end consumers.

For example, Uber, Ola, Zomato, and Paytm are consumer product-based companies. In addition, there are companies such as Wingify, Freshdesk , WebEngage, CleverTap, these products are used by other companies so these also fall under product-based companies.

Service-based companies includes names such as TCS, Cognizant, Infosys, etc. These companies offer their service to other companies.

Product-based companies pay better than other companies in the IT industry. Which is why most people want get into product-based companies. While as a fresher, you get 3–4 LPA in a service-based company, you can get a 5–6 LPA in a product-based company.

But I would admit that getting into a product-based company is harder than getting into a service-based company.

How?

service-based companies mostly hire freshers on the basis of their analytical and logical aptitude, and then train them on technologies as per their project requirements.

While product-based companies take a lot of things into consideration while hiring. Analytical and logical aptitude is just one of them. Product-based companies mostly look for knowledge of the technology they work on. Unlike service-based companies, most product-based companies do not ‘hire and train’, they simply hire people with skills in their respective technology.

So if you want to get a job in a product-based company, first make sure that you have the skills in their respective technology. I will help you out here—

Most jobs in product-based companies are created around—

Front-end development: Where you work on building an interface. HTML5, CSS3, Jquery, Bootstrap and advance frameworks like Angular, React are the technologies that you necessarily need to know.
Back-end development: Where you work on making websites /web applications more functional. You need to know a server-side programming language like PHP, JavaScript, Python etc. and related framework. For instance, if you’re using PHP, you would need to know Laravel or other PHP-based framework.
Full-stack development: Where you work on both front-end and back-end development. So you need to know technologies used across both.
Data science: Here you work with huge amount of data and try to solve some of the business problems. You need to know R, Python, statistics, and machine learning.
As you might notice, the above skills are hardly taught as part of college curriculum. So you need to learn these skills. You can use platforms like Udemy, Udacity, edWisor, edureka to learn the above skills.

One more thing I would like to add here is to work on projects. Working on projects will help you build your proficiency. Also, when you apply for a job at a company, projects will be the first thing recruiters will ask for. Recruiters have no other way to assess your skills, but through the projects you show them.

Once you have learned the required skills and built a portfolio, you can go ahead and apply to product-based companies.

How can you apply at product-based companies?

These are the two ways you can apply for a job at a product-based company—

By applying on a company’s website.
Most product-based companies like Flipkart, Zomato, Amazon, etc have dedicated careers page where you can apply directly by posting your resume. 
So if you have a particular company in mind, go to its website and apply

By using portals like Jobsaspire, Angellist.
There are multiple portals where product-based companies post openings. You can apply directly from these portals.

All in all, if you want to get a job at a product-based company, you should follow this simple approach—

Learn the technologies that most product-based companies are using.
Work on projects and build your portfolio
Get hired !
Since you’re specifically looking to get a job in a product-based company, I would recommend you to use edWisor. Here you can learn front-end development, full-stack development, and even complete data science while working on projects. The projects you do here can be easily used as your portfolio.
